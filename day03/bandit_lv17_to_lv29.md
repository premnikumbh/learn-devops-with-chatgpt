level 17 | user - bandit16 | password - kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

Hint for password of bandit17
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
