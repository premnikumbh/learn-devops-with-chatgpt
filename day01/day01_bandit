Created new file for Bandit game

password for first level was inside the readme file.
i had to verify the current directory and the file.
the i opened the file using nano editor and got the password.
level 1 - ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

had to use cat./- to see the password for next level
level 2 - 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

the file containing the password for next level had spaces in it.
had to use backslash after each word to point at that file. used cat to display the content of that file

level 3 - MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx

the folder was hidden, had to use cd ~/inhere to change dir. and open using nano

level 4 - 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

the folder was hidden, and there were multiple files. had to chech the file type using file ./* command to check the file having ASCII coding ofr the password.

level 5 - 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

with this i have succesfully cracked pasword upto level 5.

these were conditions. 
human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable
i had learn about adding on conditions to find. i added size to find .
this was command i needed to use
find . -type f -size 1033c
this gave single file output and hence further conditions were not required.
however following are the addon conditions for proper usage.
! -executable ; - not executable
-exec file '{}' \ - to show file types
grep ascii to filter ascii



level 6 - HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
